# Howdigo
You finished your project? How'd it go?

You can say it went well and that you learned a lot while building it, but what did the public think of it? 
Would companies be impressed? 

Howdigo Report Builder can help you validate your project by backing it up with visualized data 
from various social/web platforms (Reddit only so far). Employers like being presented facts, and your data could be 
what separates you from those who only TALK about their projects. 


Step 1: Submit posts of your project in subreddit communities you think will value your project, 
      then give it a little time to allow people to see it and give feedback.

Step 2: Create a Reddit Application (Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgfgtzIhBQ&t=445s) and insert your app's info 
        into 'report/api.ini'  
        
Step 3: you can run 'pip install -r .\requirements.txt' if you don't have all the dependencies (This was built w/ Python 3.6)

Step 4: Run 'python .\main.py' at the command line.
